		<h3> Look Up! </h3> <!--this heading is smaller than the first one because it is h3 instead of h1-->
		<p> Maho beach is most known for the planes that fly <b>right over</b> the beaches. The sandy white beaches are located at the end of one of the island's airport runways. This allows for beach goers to sit and enjoy their beach day while also enjoying the sight of the airplanes fly yards above their heads. </p>

		<h3> Reviews: </h3> 
			<ul>
				<li> I loved my trip to maho beach. It was a great time with family and friends. The people on the island were very nice and the beaches are beautiful. We went snorkeling and I definitely recommend it!!! I thought that the idea of the airplanes flying above was interesting but my only complaint is that the constant roar of the plane's engine was not relaxing and kind of took away from the beach. - Kathy Jones </li>
